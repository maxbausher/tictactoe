## Game Description
- Face off against your opponent in an epic battle of naughts & crosses.
- Advance through the 12 available levels, until one of the players has one 6 rounds.
- Why just 6 rounds? Well, there are only 6 types of Infinity Stones in existence. The players are on a race to collect them all before their opposition!

## Features

- 1) While the current state of the game is reset, if the browser is refreshed or closed, your infinity stones will be saved!
